"""
Agent Definitions Module.

This module defines the specific AI personas (Agents) that will execute the 
financial analysis workflow. Each agent is equipped with a distinct set of tools 
and a specific backstory to ensure separation of concerns.

Agents:
    1. Quantitative Analyst: Focuses on hard financial metrics (P/E, Beta, etc.).
    2. Investment Strategist: Focuses on qualitative news, sentiment, and synthesis.
